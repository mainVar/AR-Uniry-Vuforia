# AR_Uniry-
This repository is created to store applications that work with AR (using Unity + Vuforia)
5 days were spent on the project, 5-6 hours every day. I did such a project for the first time (with augmented reality), because most of the time I spent on getting acquainted with the documentation, technologies and features of use.
